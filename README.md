**US Department of Transportation (USDOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO) Intersection GeoJSON Converter**

The JPO Intersection GeoJSON Converter is a real-time validator and data converter of JPO-ODE MAP and SPaT JSON based on the SAE J2735 message standard. Messages are consumed from Kafka and validated based on both the SAE J2735 standard and the more robust Connected Transportation Interoperability (CTI) Intersection Implementation Guide Message Requirements (Section 3.3.3). Message validation occurs simultaneously as the GeoJSON converter converts the JPO-ODE MAP and SPaT messages into mappable geoJSON. The JPO Intersection GeoJSON Converter outputs the resulting geoJSON onto Kafka topics along with an additional property value that defines whether the message is a valid intersection message.

All stakeholders are invited to provide input to these documents. To provide feedback, we recommend that you create an "issue" in this repository (<https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-geojsonconverter/issues>). You will need a GitHub account to create an issue. If you don’t have an account, a dialog will be presented to you to create one at no cost.

<a name="usgage-example"/>

## 1. Usage Example

Once the ODE is deployed and running locally, you may access the ODE's demonstration console by opening your browser and navigating to  `http://localhost:8080`.

1.  Press the `Connect` button to connect to the ODE WebSocket service.
2.  Press `Select File` button to select an OBU log file containing BSMs and/or TIM messages as specified by the WYDOT CV Pilot project. See below documents for details:
    - [Wyoming CV Pilot Log File Design](data/Wyoming_CV_Pilot_Log_File_Design.docx)
    - [WYDOT Log Records](data/wydotLogRecords.h)
3.  Press `Upload` button to upload the file to ODE.

Upload records within the files must be embedding BSM and/or TIM messages wrapped in J2735 MessageFrame and ASN.1 UPER encoded, wrapped in IEEE 1609.2 envelope and ASN.1 COER encoded binary format. Please review the files in the [data](data) folder for samples of each supported type. By uploading a valid data file, you will be able to observe the decoded messages contained within the file appear in the web UI page while connected to the WebSocket interface.

Another way data can be uploaded to the ODE is through copying the file to the location specified by the `ode.uploadLocationRoot/ode.uploadLocationObuLog`property. If not specified,  Default locations would be `uploads/bsmlog`sub-directory off of the location where ODE is launched.

The result of uploading and decoding of messages will be displayed on the UI screen.

_Figure 2: ODE UI demonstrating message subscription_

Notice that the empty fields in the J2735 message are represented by a `null` value. Also note that ODE output strips the MessageFrame header and returns a pure BSM or TIM in the subscription topic.


With the PPM module running, all filtered BSMs that are uploaded through the web interface will be captured and processed. You will see an output of both submitted BSM and processed data unless the entire record was filtered out.

## 2. Configuration

### System Requirements

Recommended machine specs running Docker to run the GeoJsonConverter:
-  Minimum RAM: 16 GB
-  Minimum storage space: 100 GB
-  Supported operating systems:
   -  Ubuntu 18.04 Linux (Recommended)
   -  Windows 10 Professional (Professional version required for Docker virtualization)
   -  OSX 10 Mojave

The GeoJsonConverter software can run on most standard Window, Mac, or Linux based computers with
Pentium core processors. Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in
the system.  Larger data flows can require much larger space requirements depending on the
amount of data being processed by the software. The GeoJsonConverter software application was developed using the open source programming language Java. If running the GeoJsonConverter outside of Docker, the application requires the Java 11 runtime environment.

### Software Prerequisites

The GeoJsonConverter is a micro service that runs as an independent application but serves the sole purpose of converting JSON objects created by the JPO-ODE. To support these JSON objects, the GeoJsonConverter application utilizes some classes from the JPO-ODE repository. This is included into the GeoJsonConverter as a submodule. All other required dependencies will automatically be downloaded and installed as part of the Docker build process.

- Docker: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>
- Docker-Compose: <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>

### Tips and Advice

Read the following guides to familiarize yourself with GeoJsonConverter's Docker and the ODE managed Kafka modules.

- [Docker README](docker.md)
- [ODE Kafka README](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/blob/dev/kafka.md)

**Installation and Deployment:**

- Docker builds may fail if you are on a corporate network due to DNS resolution errors.
- Windows users may find more information on installing and using Docker [here](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/wiki/Docker-management).
- Users interested in Kafka may find more guidance and configuration options [here](docker/kafka/README.md).

**Configuration:**

The GeoJsonConverter configuration is customized through the environment variables provided to Docker when Docker-Compose runs the Docker built GeoJsonConverter image. You may customize the Kafka broker endpoint.

**Important!**
You must rename `sample.env` to `.env` for Docker to automatically read the file. Do not push this file to source control.

<a name="installation"/>

## 3. Installation

The following instructions describe the minimal procedure to fetch, build, and run the main GeoJsonConverter application.

#### Step 0 - For Windows Users Only

If running on Windows, please make sure that your global git config is set up to not convert end-of-line characters during checkout.

Disable `git core.autocrlf` (One Time Only)

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

#### Step 1 - Download the Source Code

The ODE software system consists of the following modules hosted in separate Github repositories:

|Name|Visibility|Description|
|----|----------|-----------|
|[jpo-geojsonconverter](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-geojsonconverter)|public|Contains the public components of the application code.|
|[jpo-ode](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode)|public|Contains the public classes and libraries of the jpo-ode used in the GeoJsonConverter.|

You may download the stable, default branch for ALL of these dependencies by using the following recursive git clone command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-geojsonconverter.git
```

Once you have these repositories obtained, you are ready to build and deploy the application.

#### Step 2 - Build and run the application

**Notes:**
- Docker builds may fail if you are on a corporate network due to DNS resolution errors.
- In order for Docker to automatically read the environment variable file, you must rename it from `sample.env` to `.env`. **This file will contain private keys, do not put add it to version control.**

Navigate to the root directory of the jpo-geojsonconverter project and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

To bring down the services and remove the running containers run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
For a fresh restart, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

To completely rebuild from scratch, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose rm -fvs
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

## Environment variables

### Purpose & Usage

- The DOCKER_HOST_IP environment variable is used to communicate with the bootstrap server that the instance of Kafka is running on.

### Values
In order to utilize Confluent Cloud:

- DOCKER_HOST_IP must be set to the bootstrap server address (excluding the port)
